`JS` is a easy script language to learn.

How to initially a variable?
----------------------------

Use `var` and make a token be a variable, like `"var" TOKEN "=" VALUE ";"`:

``` javascript
var a = 13;
var b = 'hello world';
```

About Comment
-------------

`JS`'s comment looks like `C/C++`, it can use `\\` or `\*...*\`.

About the value
---------------

### Number

`JS` has a type named `Number`, such as `100`, `0.01` or special number `NaN`.

It has the same rule to get the value by expression:

``` javascript
(1 + 2) * 5 / 2; // 7.5
```
