The Electron React Boilderplate
===============================

This is a template about how to build electron application with react. I try to
use `create-electron-application` but it is not good when I just want to make it
work with `electron` - it need open a local host's port and then the electron
application hold it. It is not a good idea.

So I try to use the template and then hope it can work well.

Where is it? How to install it?
-------------------------------

It is [here](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

And we also need download a yarn, it can help us to download want it need firstly.
(but it is really slow! How can I do for it?)

I am learning how to use `Webpack` now... It is not easy for me, and the language
`node.js` is always run difference with what I hope it going.

After follow it to run `yarn` and `yarn dev` to install all it need, I run `yarn start` but it tell me I need use `chown` and `chmod` to make the `chrome-sandbox` can work well. Then I run `yarn start` and now it do work!
