`Create-react-app` is too slow
============================

When I run `create-react-app` under `VirtualBox`, it is too slow!

I try to change the way to content with network, such as `NAT`, `Bridge` or
`Host-Only`, but those are not work at all.

Then at last I `unset` all `env variable` like `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`
then I make it!

I do not know why! I need to know more about `TCP/IP` and network.'
