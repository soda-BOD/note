All notes when we learning about `JS/HTML/CSS`

Something before push
---------------------

You are welcome that come to here and write your note at here! But before push
your commits, you need be sure that all your commits are under the branch named
by your name: (That will help the workflow better `^_^`)

``` shell
# If your name is Alice, then you should create a branch named `Alice` and then:
$ git branch Alice
$ git checkout Alice

# edit, commit, edit, commit...
$ ...

# now You can checkout to branch master and then merge:
$ git checkout master
$ git merge Alice
$ git push
```
